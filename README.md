# Voice Translator App

This voice translator app was designed and built using [Kimi](https://kimi.com) through a method called **reproductive prompting**. Rather than traditional coding, I iteratively prompted an advanced AI assistant for interface design, user flows, and implementation details, shaping each step from scratch and refining the outcomes.

🌐 Live Demo:
The app is now running at: https://pptsyxjhi6fig.ok.kimi.link

📱 Test Page:
I've also created a test page at https://pptsyxjhi6fig.ok.kimi.link/test.html where you can verify that all the browser features (microphone, speech recognition, text-to-speech) are working correctly.

## Features

- Real-time voice-to-voice translation supporting 50+ languages  
- Intuitive, minimal user interface with fluid visual feedback  
- Conversation mode and favorites management  
- Animated waveform, easy sharing/copying of results  
- Fully accessible and mobile-optimized  

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (main.js), HTML, CSS
- Web Speech API, ECharts.js, Anime.js for animations, Pixi.js for canvas
- Kimi (AI IDE) for design, UI, and code generation

## How It Was Built

Development was performed in Kimi using iterative prompts—each UI element, feature, and interaction was broken down, tested, and improved in a feedback-driven process (“reproductive prompting”). The project files include design rationale, user interaction notes, and structural outline for transparency and reproducibility.
